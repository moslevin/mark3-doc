The reality of system code</h1>
<p>System code can be defined as the program logic required to manage, synchronize, and schedule all of the resources (CPU time, memory, peripherals, etc.) used by the application running on the CPU. And it's true that a significant portion of the code running on an embedded system will be system code. No matter how simple a system is, whether or not this logic is embedded directly into the application (bare-metal system), or included as part of a well-defined stack on which an application is written (RTOS-based); system code is still present, and it comes with a cost.</p>
<p>As an embedded systems is being designed, engineers have to decide which approach to take: Bare-metal, or RTOS. There are advantages and disadvantages to each – and a reasonable engineer should always perform a thorough analysis of the pros and cons of each - in the context of the given application - before choosing a path.</p>
<p>The following figure demonstrates the differences between the architecture of a bare-metal system and RTOS based system at a high level:</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="Mark3_arch.png" alt="Mark3_arch.png"/>
</div>
 <p>As can be seen, the RTOS (And associated middleware + libraries) captures a certain fixed size.</p>
<p>As a generalization, bare-metal systems typically have the advantage in that the system code overhead is small to start – but grows significantly as the application grows in complexity. At a certain point, it becomes extremely difficult and error-prone to add more functionality to an application running on such a system. There's a tipping point, where the cost of the code used to work-around the limitations of a bare-metal system outweigh the cost of a capable RTOS. Bare-metal systems also generally take longer to implement, because the system code has to be written from scratch (or derived from existing code) for the application. The resulting code also tend to be less portable, as it takes serious discipline to keep the system-specific elements of the code separated – in an RTOS-based system, once the kernel and drivers are ported, the application code is generally platform agnostic.</p>
<p>Conversely, an RTOS-based system incurs a slightly higher fixed cost up-front, but scales infinitely better than a bare-metal system as application's complexity increases. Using an RTOS for simple systems reduces application development time, but may cause an application not to fit into some extremely size-constrained microcontroller. An RTOS can also cause the size of an application to grow more slowly relative to a bare-metal system – especially as a result of applying synchronization mechanisms and judicious IPC. As a result, an RTOS makes it significantly easier to “go agile” with an application – iteratively adding features and functionality, without having to consider refactoring the underlying system at each turn.</p>
<p>Some of these factors may be more important than others. Requirements, specifications, schedules, chip-selection, and volume projections for a project should all be used to feed into the discussions to decide whether or to go bare-metal or RTOS as a result.</p>
<p>Consider the following questions when making that decision:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the application?</li>
<li>How efficient is efficient enough?</li>
<li>How fast is fast enough?</li>
<li>How small is small enough?</li>
<li>How responsive is responsive enough?</li>
<li>How much code space/RAM/etc is available on the target system?</li>
<li>How much code space/RAM do I need for an RTOS?</li>
<li>How much code space/RAM do I think I'll need for my application?</li>
<li>How much time do I have to deliver my system?</li>
<li>How many units do we plan to sell?</li>
</ul>

Superloops, and their limitations</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="WHENSUPERINTRO"></a>
Intro to Superloops</h2>
<p>Before we start taking a look at designing a real-time operating system, it's worthwhile taking a look through one of the most-common design patterns that developers use to manage task execution in bare-metal embedded systems - Superloops.</p>
<p>Systems based on superloops favor the system control logic baked directly into the application code, usually under the guise of simplicity, or memory (code and RAM) efficiency. For simple systems, superloops can definitely get the job done. However, they have some serious limitations, and are not suitable for every kind of project. In a lot of cases you can squeak by using superloops - especially in extremely constrained systems, but in general they are not a solid basis for reusable, portable code.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, a variety of examples are presented here- from the extremely simple, to cooperative and liimted-preemptive multitasking systems, all of which are examples are representative of real-world systems that I've either written the firmware for, or have seen in my experience.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="WHENSUPERSIMPLE"></a>
The simplest loop</h2>
<p>Let's start with the simplest embedded system design possible - an infinite loop that performs a single task repeatedly:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keywordtype">int</span> main()</div><div class="line">{</div><div class="line">    <span class="keywordflow">while</span>(1)</div><div class="line">    {</div><div class="line">        Do_Something();</div><div class="line">    }</div><div class="line">}</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>Here, the code inside the loop will run a single function forever and ever. Not much to it, is there? But you might be surprised at just how much embedded system firmware is implemented using essentially the same mechanism - there isn't anything wrong with that, but it's just not that interesting.</p>
<p>Despite its simplicity we can see the beginnings of some core OS concepts. Here, the while(1) statement can be logically seen as the he operating system kernel - this one control statement determines what tasks can run in the system, and defines the constraints that could modify their execution. But at the end of the day, that's a big part of what a kernel is - a mechanism that controls the execution of application code.</p>
<p>The second concept here is the task. This is application code provided by the user to perform some useful purpose in a system. In this case Do_something() represents that task - it could be monitoring blood pressure, reading a sensor and writing its data to a terminal, or playing an MP3; anything you can think of for an embedded system to do. A simple round-robin multi-tasking system can be built off of this example by simply adding additional tasks in sequence in the main while-loop. Note that in this example the CPU is always busy running tasks - at no time is the CPU idle, meaning that it is likely burning a lot of power.</p>
<p>While we conceptually have two separate pieces of code involved here (an operating system kernel and a set of running tasks), they are not logically separate. The OS code is indistinguishable from the application. It's like a single-celled organism - everything is crammed together within the walls of an indivisible unit; and specialized to perform its given function relying solely on instinct.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="WHENSUPERINTER"></a>
Interrupt-Driven Super-loop</h2>
<p>In the previous example, we had a system without any way to control the execution of the task- it just runs forever. There's no way to control when the task can (or more importantly can't) run, which greatly limits the usefulness of the system. Say you only want your task to run every 100 miliseconds - in the previous code, you have to add a hard-coded delay at the end of your task's execution to ensure your code runs only when it should.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is a much more elegant way to do this. In this example, we introduce the concept of the synchronization object. A Synchronization object is some data structure which works within the bounds of the operating system to tell tasks when they can run, and in many cases includes special data unique to the synchronization event.</p>
<p>There are a whole family of synchronization objects, which we'll get into later. In this example, we make use of the simplest synchronization primitive</p><ul>
<li>the global flag.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the addition of synchronization brings the addition of event-driven systems. If you're programming a microcontroller system, you generally have scores of peripherals available to you - timers, GPIOs, ADCs, UARTs, ethernet, USB, etc. All of which can be configured to provide a stimulus to your system by means of interrupts. This stimulus gives us the ability not only to program our micros to do_something(), but to do_something() if-and-only-if a corresponding trigger has occurred.</p>
<p>The following concepts are shown in the example below:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keyword">volatile</span> K_BOOL something_to_do = <span class="keyword">false</span>;</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">__interrupt__ My_Interrupt_Source(<span class="keywordtype">void</span>)</div><div class="line">{</div><div class="line">    something_to_do = <span class="keyword">true</span>;</div><div class="line">}</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line"><span class="keywordtype">int</span> main()</div><div class="line">{</div><div class="line">    <span class="keywordflow">while</span> (1)</div><div class="line">    {</div><div class="line">        <span class="keywordflow">if</span> (something_to_do)</div><div class="line">        {</div><div class="line">            Do_something();</div><div class="line">            something_to_do = <span class="keyword">false</span>;</div><div class="line">        }</div><div class="line">        <span class="keywordflow">else</span></div><div class="line">        {</div><div class="line">            Idle();</div><div class="line">        }</div><div class="line">    }</div><div class="line">}</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>So there you have it - an event driven system which uses a global variable to synchronize the execution of our task based on the occurrence of an interrupt. It's still just a bare-metal, OS-baked-into-the-application system, but it's introduced a whole bunch of added complexity (and control!) into the system.</p>
<p>The first thing to notice in the source is that the global variable, something_to_do, is used as a synchronization object. When an interrupt occurs from some external event, triggering the My_Interrupt_Source() ISR, program flow in main() is interrupted, the interrupt handler is run, and something_to_do is set to true, letting us know that when we get back to main(), that we should run our Do_something() task.</p>
<p>Another new concept at play here is that of the idle function. In general, when running an event driven system, there are times when the CPU has no application tasks to run. In order to minimize power consumption, CPUs usually contain instructions or registers that can be set up to disable non-essential subsets of the system when there's nothing to do. In general, the sleeping system can be re-activated quickly as a result of an interrupt or other external stimulus, allowing normal processing to resume.</p>
<p>Now, we could just call Do_something() from the interrupt itself - but that's generally not a great solution. In general, the more time we spend inside an interrupt, the more time we spend with at least some interrupts disabled. As a result, we end up with interrupt latency. Now, in this system, with only one interrupt source and only one task this might not be a big deal, but say that Do_something() takes several seconds to complete, and in that time several other interrupts occur from other sources. While executing in our long-running interrupt, no other interrupts can be processed - in many cases, if two interrupts of the same type occur before the first is processed, one of these interrupt events will be lost. This can be utterly disastrous in a real-time system and should be avoided at all costs. As a result, it's generally preferable to use synchronization objects whenever possible to defer processing outside of the ISR.</p>
<p>Another OS concept that is implicitly introduced in this example is that of task priority. When an interrupt occurs, the normal execution of code in main() is preempted: control is swapped over to the ISR (which runs to completion), and then control is given back to main() where it left off. The very fact that interrupts take precedence over what's running shows that main is conceptually a "low-priority" task, and that all ISRs are "high-priority" tasks. In this example, our "high-priority" task is setting a variable to tell our "low-priority" task that it can do something useful. We will investigate the concept of task priority further in the next example.</p>
<p>Preemption is another key principle in embedded systems. This is the notion that whatever the CPU is doing when an interrupt occurs, it should stop, cache its current state (referred to as its context), and allow the high-priority event to be processed. The context of the previous task is then restored its state before the interrupt, and resumes processing. We'll come back to preemption frequently, since the concept comes up frequently in RTOS-based systems.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="WHENSUPERCOOP"></a>
Cooperative multi-tasking</h2>
<p>Our next example takes the previous example one step further by introducing cooperative multi-tasking:</p>

First, we have stimulus from multiple interrupt sources: each ISR is responsible for setting a single bit in our global event flag, which is then used to control execution of individual tasks from within main().</p>
<p>Next, we can see that tasks are explicitly given priorities inside the main loop based on the logic of the if/else if structure. As long as there is something set in the event flag, we will always try to execute Task1 first, and only when Task1 isn't set will we attempt to execute Task2, and then Task3. This added logic provides the notion of priority. However, because each of these tasks exist within the same context (they're just different functions called from our main control loop), we don't have the same notion of preemption that we have when dealing with interrupts.</p>
<p>That means that even through we may be running Task2 and an event flag for Task1 is set by an interrupt, the CPU still has to finish processing Task2 to completion before Task1 can be run. And that's why this kind of scheduling is referred to as cooperative multitasking: we can have as many tasks as we want, but unless they cooperate by means of returning back to main, the system can end up with high-priority tasks getting starved for CPU time by lower-priority, long-running tasks.</p>
<p>This is one of the more popular Os-baked-into-the-application approaches, and is widely used in a variety of real-time embedded systems.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="WHENSUPERHYBRID"></a>
Hybrid cooperative/preemptive multi-tasking</h2>
<p>The final variation on the superloop design utilizes software-triggered interrupts to simulate a hybrid cooperative/preemptive multitasking system. Consider the example code below.</p>

When a high-priority event is set, the code that sets the event calls the SWI as well, which instantly preempts whatever is happening in main, switching to the high-priority interrupt handler. If the CPU is executing in an interrupt handler already, the current ISR completes, at which point control is given to the high priority interrupt handler.</p>
<p>Once inside the HP ISR, all interrupts (except the software interrupt) are re-enabled, which allows this interrupt to be preempted by other interrupt sources, which is called interrupt nesting. As a result, we end up with two distinct execution contexts (main and HighPriorityTasks()), in which all tasks in the high-priority group are guaranteed to preempt main() tasks, and will run to completion before returning control back to tasks in main(). This is a very basic preemptive multitasking scenario, approximating a "real" RTOS system with two threads of different priorities.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="WHENPROB"></a>
Problems with superloops</h1>
<p>As mentioned earlier, a lot of real-world systems are implemented using a superloop design; and while they are simple to understand due to the limited and obvious control logic involved, they are not without their problems.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="WHENPROBHIDDEN"></a>
Hidden Costs</h2>
<p>It's difficult to calculate the overhead of the superloop and the code required to implement workarounds for blocking calls, scheduling, and preemption. There's a cost in both the logic used to implement workarounds (usually involving state machines), as well as a cost to maintainability that comes with breaking up into chunks based on execution time instead of logical operations. In moderate firmware systems, this size cost can exceed the overhead of a reasonably well-featured RTOS, and the deficit in maintainability is something that is measurable in terms of lost productivity through debugging and profiling.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="WHENPROBTIGHTLY"></a>
Tightly-coupled code</h2>
<p>Because the control logic is integrated so closely with the application logic, a lot of care must be taken not to compromise the separation between application and system code. The timing loops, state machines, and architecture-specific control mechanisms used to avoid (or simulate) preemption can all contribute to the problem. As a result, a lot of superloop code ends up being difficult to port without effectively simulating or replicating the underlying system for which the application was written. Abstraction layers can mitigate the risks, but a lot of care should be taken to fully decouple the application code from the system code.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="WHENPROBBLOCK"></a>
No blocking Calls</h2>
<p>In a super-loop environment, there's no such thing as a blocking call or blocking objects. Tasks cannot stop mid-execution for event-driven I/O from other contexts - they must always run to completion. If busy-waiting and polling are used as a substitute, it increases latency and wastes cycles. As a result, extra code complexity is often times necessary to work-around this lack of blocking objects, often times through implementing additional state machines. In a large enough system, the added overhead in code size and cycles can add up.</p>

Difficult to guarantee responsiveness</h2>
<p>Without multiple levels of priority, it may be difficult to guarantee a certain degree of real-time responsiveness without added profiling and tweaking. The latency of a given task in a priority-based cooperative multitasking system is the length of the longest task. Care must be taken to break tasks up into appropriate sized chunks in order to ensure that higher- priority tasks can run in a timely fashion - a manual process that must be repeated as new tasks are added in the system. Once again, this adds extra complexity that makes code larger, more difficult to understand and maintain due to the artificial subdivision of tasks into time-based components.</p>

Limited preemption capability</h2>
<p>As shown in the example code, the way to gain preemption in a superloop is through the use of nested interrupts. While this isn't unwiedly for two levels of priority, adding more levels beyond this is becomes complicated. In this case, it becomes necessary to track interrupt nesting manually, and separate sets of tasks that can run within given priority loops - and deadlock becomes more difficult to avoid. </p>
